# ðŸŽ¬ Netflix-Style Content Recommendation Pipeline

This project simulates a **real-time + batch data pipeline** for personalized content recommendations, inspired by Netflix's data infrastructure. It demonstrates end-to-end data engineering skills: event ingestion, streaming and batch processing, preference modeling, and API delivery.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

- Simulate user watch behavior as streaming events
- Process and store data in real time using **Kafka + Spark Streaming**
- Aggregate historical preferences using **batch ETL** with **PySpark/dbt**
- Generate recommendations using real-time + batch layers
- Expose recommendations through a **FastAPI** service
- Orchestrate components using **Docker**
